## 1. Overview

The goal of this project is to build a basic but functional Social Networking Service (SNS) that allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete posts; add comments; and like/unlike posts. The API-first approach ensures that it can be used as a backend for web or mobile frontends.

## 2. Background

Contoso is a company that sells products for various outdoor activities. A marketing department of Contoso would like to launch a micro social media website to promote their products for existing and potential customers. As their first MVP, the marketing department wants to quickly build the website.
